# Mushroom Classifier

Welcome to the Mushroom Classifier GitHub repository! This project leverages a Support Vector Classifier (SVC) model to determine whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous based on its physical attributes. Developed with Python and deployed via Gradio on Hugging Face Spaces, this tool aims to provide an interactive and user-friendly way to promote safety and knowledge in mushroom foraging.

## Project Overview

This repository contains all the code and data necessary for training and deploying the Mushroom Classifier. The classifier uses a machine learning model trained on a dataset with various attributes such as cap shape, cap surface, cap color, and more, to predict the edibility of mushrooms.

## Installation

To set up this project locally, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AmanSCoder/MushroomClassification
cd mushroom-classifier
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To run the Gradio interface locally and interact with the model:

```bash
python app.py


Alternatively, you can access the deployed model directly via Hugging Face Spaces:

## How It Works

### Data Preprocessing

- The data is cleaned and preprocessed using `pandas` to ensure it is suitable for training the machine learning model.
- `LabelEncoder` from `sklearn.preprocessing` is used to transform categorical data into a suitable format for the model.

### Model Training

- The model is trained using `scikit-learn`'s SVC implementation, which is well-suited for classification tasks.
- After training, the model is saved using `pickle` to ensure it can be easily loaded for future predictions.

### Deployment

- The model is integrated with a Gradio interface, allowing users to select mushroom features through dropdown menus and submit them for prediction.
- It is deployed on Hugging Face Spaces for easy access and interaction by users worldwide.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language used.
- **Scikit-Learn**: For implementing the machine learning model.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **Gradio**: To create the web interface.
- **Hugging Face Spaces**: For hosting the deployed model.
